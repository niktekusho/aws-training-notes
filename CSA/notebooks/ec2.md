# AWS Elastic Compute Cloud

AWS is a way to run virtual servers in the cloud.

In AWS data centers, an EC2 host can run multiple EC2 instances using server virtualization.

EC2 hosts are managed by AWS.

User manages EC2 instances.

An EC2 instance is a virtual server with a specific amount of cores, memory, storage and network capabilities and a choice of OS (Linux, Windows and macOS). On top of the OS you install applications.

An instance type is a template of the server which specifies available resources (cores, memory, etc.).
The instance type defines the hardware profile and the cost.

Launch EC2 instance interactively:

1. Login to AWS Management Console
2. "launch an EC2 instance"
3. Select the instance type
4. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

AMI = OS + basic config = configuration of an EC2 instance

AMI is created from an EBS snapshot.

EBS snapshot = point in time backup of an instance.

EBS = Elastic Block Store volume = Virtual storage

AMIs can be created by the user with the customization they want.

EC2 instance types

| Family            | Type       | vCPUs | Memory (GB) |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| General Purpose   | t2.micro   | 1     | 1           |
| Compute Optimized | c5n.large  | 2     | 5,25        |
| Memory Optimized  | r5ad.large | 2     | 16          |
| Storage Optimized | d2.xlarge  | 4     | 30,5        |
| GPU instances     | g2.2xlarge | 8     | 15          |

Benefits of EC2:

- elastic computing = launch hundreds of EC2 instances within minutes
- complete control = instance creator has root access to the virtual server
- flexible = instance creator can choose instance types, OS and installed software
- reliable = high availability and instances can be replaced quickly when failure occurs
- secure = integrated in AWS VPC
- inexpensive = pay per use and/or low cost

VPC = Virtual Private Cloud = User's virtual data center 

EC2 instance in Public Subnet = can connect to the instance with an internet connection.

EC2 hierarcy (?):

Region -> VPC -> Availability zone -> Public/Private Subnet -> EC2 instances

EC2 instances can have a security group.
Security Group = Firewall = Ports + Protocols + IP Addresses that can connect to an EC2 instance.
Security Group controls inbound and outbound traffic.

Internet Gateway enables access from/to the internet and is attached to the VPC.

EC2 admin user -> Internet Gateway -> EC2 instance

## EC2 Launch Wizard

*Is this needed?

## EC2 User Data

It's a mechanism used to run code/commands when the instance starts for the first time.

Passed code is limited to 16 KB!

Linux instances can use bash/posix sh scripts.
Windows instances can use "batch" and PowerShell scripts.

## EC2 Metadata

EC2 Metadata = info about a specific EC2 instance.

Available in the EC2 instance at: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data (local to the machine, does not connect to the internet)

Example output:

```sh
$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
ami-id
ami-launch-index
...
hostname
...
instance-id
...
instance-type
...
local-hostname
local-ipv4
...


$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4
172.31.42.248


```


## Accessing Services with Access Keys and IAM Roles

### Access Keys

- Access Keys allow an EC2 instance to connect to an other service securely.
- Access Keys are generated by a IAM User.
- Access Key uses permissions assigned to the user via policies.
- EC2 instance can then use the Access Keys. 
- Major drawback: Access Keys are stored on the instance file system in plaintext!!! File is `~/.aws/credentials`!


### IAM Roles

- Instance profile: way to connect an IAM Role to a specific EC2 instance.
- EC2 instance has a IAM Role attached to it.
- EC2 instance "AssumeRole"s the specified IAM Role.
- EC2 instance gains access to resources based on the permissions defined in the policy attached to the Role.
- NO CREDENTIALS STORED ON THE EC2 INSTANCE!

## EC2 Instances status and monitoring

2 types of status checks:

- System Status Checks = AWS checks the underlying hardware of the EC2 instance. If something is wrong, AWS Customer Support needs to be involved.
- Instance Status Checks = AWS checks the software and networking configuration of the EC2 instance. If something is wrong, the "user" needs to be involved.

EC2 monitors:

- CPU utilization (%)
- Total Status Checks failed (count)
- System Status Checks failed (count)
- Instance Status Checks failed (count)
- Network inbound traffic (Bytes)
- Network outbound traffic (Bytes)
- Network packets inbound (count)
- Network packets outbound (count)
- Disk reads (Bytes)
- Disk read Operations (op/s)
- Disk writes (Bytes)
- Disk write Operations (op/s)
- CPU Credit Usage (count)
- CPU Credit Balance (count)

All the previous data goes through AWS CloudWatch.
CloudWatch = Performance Monitoring tool

Basic monitoring (free): EC2 instance sends data to CloudWatch every 5 minutes.
Detailed monitoring (paid): EC2 instance sends data to CloudWatch every 1 minute.

## EC2 Placement Groups

Mechanism that allows you to control where AWS deploys EC2 instances in Availability Zones or across them.

Availability Zone ~= Datacenter

Placement groups options:

1. Cluster Placement Group = instances will be deployed close together inside an Availability Zone (example same rack).
  - Low Latency
  - High network throughput
  - Inside a single Availability Zone
  - Best used for thightly-coupled services (HPC applications) that interact among them a lot
2. Partition Placement Group = instances will be deployed across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share hardware with groups of instances in different partitions.
   - Inside a single Availability Zone (at least different racks) or across multiple AZs
   - Max 7 partitions per Availability Zone
   - Best used for distributed and replicated workloads (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka) (separate hardware for node groups)
3. Spread Placement Group = each individual instance will be deployed across distinct underlying hardware.
   - Each instance is deployed on a separate rack
   - Reduces correlated failures
   - Best used for small number of critical instances that must be kept separate

To create a Placement Group you need to specify:

1. name of the Placement Group
2. type of the Placement Group

You can create Placement Groups while creating a new EC2 instance.

## Network Interfaces

Every network interface will have a private IP address.
Network interfaces may have public IP addresses (when explicitly configured).

Network interfaces are attached to a subnet within an Availability Zone. The EC2 instance is NOT in the subnet!
EC2 instances can be attached to multiple subnets through different adapters.

(?)Private network subnets needs to be located in the same Availability Zone of the EC2 instance.

3 types of network interface adapters:

- ENI = Elastic Network Interface
- ENA = Elastic Network Adapter
- EFA = Elastic Fabric Adapter

EC2 instance can only attach ENIs connected to subnets in the same Availability Zone.
ENIs cannot be attached to instances in a different AZ.

| Elastic Network Interface               | Elastic Network Adapter                       | Elastic Fabric Adapter                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic Adapter                           | Enhanced networking performance               | Specialized network use cases                                                                                         |
| Can be used with all EC2 Instance Types | Can be used only on supported Instance Types  | Can be used with all EC2 Instance Types                                                                               |
| Medium/Low network performance          | High bandwidth and low inter-instance latency | Low latency                                                                                                           |
|                                         |                                               | Best used for HPC, MPI and ML workloads, where applications are thightly couped and have a lot of intercommunication. |

MPI = Message Passing Interface = (?)


### Types of IP addresses

1. Public IP address = dynamic address (changes when restarting an EC2 instance), used in public subnets, free, associated with a private IP address on the instance, cannot be moved between instances
2. Private IP address = static address (does not change when restarting EC2 instance), used in public and private subnets
3. Elastic IP address = public static address, paid when not used, associated with a private IP address on the instance, can be moved between instances and ENA

Stopped EC2 instances do not have a public IP address!
Rebooted EC2 instances do keep the public IP address!

Elastic IPs can be assigned to network interfaces.
Both ENIs and EIPs can be remapped to different EC2 instances.
EIPs can be remapped across AZs.
Elastic IPs are region "specific".

Elastic IPs use cases: increase fault tolerance of applications running on EC2

- Given an EC2 instance connected to a public subnet via an ENI associated with an EIP
- When EC2 instance fails
- Then create a new EC2 instance of the applicaton, detach the ENI from the failing EC2 instance, attach the ENI to the new EC2 instance
- Clients will continue to work!

- Given an EC2 instance in AZ 1 connected to a public subnet via an ENI associated with an EIP
- Given an "equal" EC2 instance in AZ 2 connected to a public subnet via an ENI associated WITHOUT an EIP
- When EC2 instance in AZ 1 fails
- Then move the EIP from EC2 instance in AZ 1 to instance in AZ 2
- Clients will continue to work!

NAT = Network Address Translation

EC2 instances can only access the private IP address. The public/Elastic IP addresses are not stored on the instances!
Public/Elastic addresses are ASSOCIATED with the private IP of the network adapter.

Internet Gateway performs 1:1 NAT from public IP to private IP and viceversa.

Network communication flow for outbound communications:

1. EC2 instance wants to send a packet to a client
2. Network adapter of the EC2 instance writes the packet with "Src" = private IP address and "Dest" = IP address of the client
3. Internet Gateway replaces "Src" with the public/Elastic IP address

Network communication flow for inbound communications:

1. Packet arrives from a client to the Internet Gateway with "Src" = IP address of the client and "Dest" = public/Elastic IP address
2. Internet Gateway replaces "Dest" with the private IP address

### Subnets

Region -> VPC -> Availability Zone -> Public subnet

Public subnet has a route table that allows internet access.
Public subnets assign EC2 instances public IPs automatically.

Route table:

| Destination (CIDR block)   | Target | Notes                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 172.31.0.0/16 | local  | Any address block in the VPC will be in the specified range. If 2 instances are in this subnet they can communicate locally. VPC router routes requests inside the same VPC. |
| 0.0.0.0/0     | igw-id | Any other address not covered by the local route, route the request to the Internet Gateway. |



Private subnet has a separate route table WITHOUT internet access.
Private subnets cannot be attached to an Internet Gateway.

Subnets are created private by default.

It's possible to communicate between private and public subnets by using the same local CIDR block!

Subnets configuration isn't affected by Availability Zones.

Bastion Host = EC2 instance accessible from the internet that connects to another EC2 instance NOT accessible from the internet.

### NAT

NAT Gateways and NAT Instances are used to enable EC2 instances deployed in private subnets to connect to the internet (outbound only).

Used for:

- connecting to a service located to the internet
- download software and software updates

NAT Gateways should be deployed on public subnets to obtain public/Elastic IP addresses.

Private route table:

| Destination (CIDR block) | Target         |
| ------------------------ | -------------- |
| 10.0.0.0/16              | local          |
| 0.0.0.0/0                | nat-gateway-id |

NAT gateway is added to the private route table and every address not in the CIDR block of local connects to the internet.


NAT Instances = EC2 Instance configured to do what NAT Gateways do. Replaced by NAT Gateways.

NAT Instances use a special AMI `amzn-ami-vpc-nat`.
NAT Instances must disable source and destination checks to allow the translation of addresses!

#### NAT instances vs NAT gateways

- NAT instances are managed by the customer (OS updates, etc), NAT gateways by AWS
- NAT instances scale up manually (instance types) and use EC2 networking, NAT gateways provide elastic scaling up to 45 Gbps
- NAT instances do not have HA (can be done manually), NAT gateways have automatic HA inside an Availability Zone and can be created across zones
- NAT instances need to use Security Groups, NAT gateways do not (allow outbound access only)
- NAT instances can be used as Bastion Host, NAT gateways can not be accessed via SSH
- NAT instances can use Elastic IPs or public IPs, NAT gateways can only use Elastic IPs defined at creation time
- NAT instances can implement port forwarding manually, NAT gateways can not
